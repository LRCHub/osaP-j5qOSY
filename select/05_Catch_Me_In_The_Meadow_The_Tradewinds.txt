I saw her
In a setting
So upsetting to my head

Oh, stop the world around me
My eyes got stuck upon her
And, beyond her life was dead
I watched a dream surround me

I tried her hand
But the breeze took her arm
In the grass we follow
Then off she ran
Turn your head
Put your ear
To the wind
You'll hear me

Follow
Follow

Oh

Catch me (Catch me)
She said
Catch me (Catch me)
Catch me in the meadow
