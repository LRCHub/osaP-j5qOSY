Don't try to push the strong arm on me
You'd better think twice I ain't no Sandra Dee
Don't think I'm easy I wasn't born blonde
I've been around, 'n' now they here 'n' gone
And I've seen things that you'll never believe
Fast mover, 'n' you can't catch me

Can't catch me
Can't catch me
Can't catch me
Catch me if you can

I been up 'n' now I been down
I been messed up 'n' turned around
I've been a fool 'n' I been wise
I've seen shit in paradise
An' I still got the aces up my sleeve
Fast mover and you can't catch me

Can't catch me
Can't catch me
Can't catch me

Can't catch me
Can't catch me
Can't catch me
And so catch me if you can

Oh! What a pity such a pretty boy
California's little pride 'n' joy
But that ain't all it takes
It need more than just a pretty face
I deserve an ace with a little taste
Don't come sniffin' around my tree
I'm off and runnin', you can't catch me

Can't catch me
Can't catch me
Can't catch me

Can't catch me
Can't catch me
Can't catch me

Ah! No, you can't catch me
No, you can't catch me
No, you can't catch me

You ain't catch me
You ain't catch me
You ain't catch me
Ah! Catch me if you can
